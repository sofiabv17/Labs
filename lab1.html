        <p style="color:cadetblue;text-align:center;">
            I am a first-year B.Arch student at NJIT, seeking to find if and what I am most passionate about in architecture during my time here.
            I am from Elizbeth, NJ, where I reside with my two parents, my brother, and my shih-tzu dog, Nala.
            Prior to my start at NJIT, I graduated from Alexander Hamilton Preparatory Academy in Elizabeth, where I spent all four of my high school years. 
            I not only graduated as a student, but as a student athlete who took part in Elizabeth's Cross Country and Track&Field team.
            Running is a sport I grew to love and is something I hope to continue on my free time, as well.
